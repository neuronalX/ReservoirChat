## Code (not debug) questions




#### 1

I want to train my echo state network on multiple timeseries that have different lengths. I have seen in the documentation that you can put a 3D numpy array with shape (timeseries, timesteps, dimensions), but it wouldn't work in my case as the timeseries have different lengths.

A. There is no way to do that in ReservoirPy as it is most probably not a good idea to train a model with different lengths and it would induce unexpected results.
B. You can pass a list of 2D numpy arrays that represents timeseries. As lists can contain numpy arrays of different shapes, you can specify timeseries with different lengths.
C. You would have to pad every timeseries with zeros and then concatenate them.
D. As NumPy doesn't support sparse arrays, it is best to use xarray for this use-case.

Correct: B

#### 2

Make me a reservoir, with 1000 neurons, and with a uniform distribution of weights, and a sparsity of 95%.

A. 
```python

```
B.
```python
from reservoirpy.nodes import Reservoir, Ridge
model = Reservoir(100, name="1") >> Reservoir(100, name="2") >> Reservoir(100, name="3") >> Reservoir(100, name="4") >> Reservoir(100, name="5") >> Ridge(ridge=1e-5)
```
C.
```python
from reservoirpy.nodes import Reservoir, Ridge

model = Reservoir(100) > Reservoir(100) > Reservoir(100) > Reservoir(100) > Reservoir(100) > Ridge(ridge=1e-5)
```
D.
```python
from reservoirpy.nodes import Reservoir, Ridge
model = Ridge(ridge=1e-5, previous=Reservoir(100, name="5", previous=Reservoir(100, name="4", previous=Reservoir(100, name="3", previous=Reservoir(100, name="2", previous=Reservoir(100, name="1"))))))

A.
```python
import reservoirpy as rpy
rpy.set_param("backend", "parallel")

from reservoirpy.nodes import ESN
model = ESN(units=100)
model.fit(train_data, train_data)
```
B.
```python
from reservoirpy.utils import parallel
from reservoirpy.nodes import ESN
model = ESN(units=100)
with parallel(n_jobs=-1):
	model.fit(train_data, train_data)
```
C.
```python
from reservoirpy.nodes import ESN
model = ESN(units=100, workers=-1)
model.fit(train_data, train_data)
```
D. ReservoirPy already parallelize computation by default to ensure the best performances.

Correct: C

#### 5

I have a model with several trainable readouts inside as such:
```python
from reservoirpy.nodes import Reservoir, Ridge

model = Reservoir(100, name="R1") >> Ridge(name="readout1")
model >>= Reservoir(100, name="R2") >> Ridge(name="readout2")
model >>= Reservoir(100, name="R3") >> Ridge(name="readout3")
```
How can I fit the model, by specifying the Y values to each Ridge nodes ?

A. It is not possible to do such thing in ReservoirPy as it wouldn't make sense
B. You can pass a dict as a y parameter: `model.fit(X, {"readout1": Y1, "readout2": Y2, "readout3": Y3, })`
C. You would have to fit each part separately before concatenating them
D. You can specify the node names as parameters and ReservoirPy will dispatch them correctly: `model.fit(X, readout1=Y1, readout2=Y2, readout3=Y3)`

Correct: B

#### 6


I have a NumPy array `X` of shape `(timeseries, timesteps, dimensions)` and I want to classify them according to my `Y` array of shape `(timeseries, )` which contains number from 0 to 9 according to the class the timeseries belongs to. How can I do that in ReservoirPy ? 

A. 
```python
from reservoirpy.nodes import Reservoir, ScikitLearnNode, Ridge
from sklearn.linear_model import RidgeClassifier

Y_ = Y.reshape(-1, 1, 1).repeat(X.shape[1], 1)

model = Reservoir(1000, lr=0.9, sr=1.0) >> ScikitLearnNode(RidgeClassifier, model_hypers=dict(alpha: 1e-8))
model.fit(X, Y_)
```
B. Reservoir computing is only a framework for timeseries forecasting, it is not suited for classification.
C. 
```python
from reservoirpy.nodes import Reservoir, ScikitLearnNode, Ridge
from sklearn.linear_model import RidgeClassifier

model = Reservoir(1000, lr=0.9, sr=1.0) >> RidgeClassifier(alpha=1e-8)
model.fit(X, Y)
```
D. 
```python
from reservoirpy.nodes import Reservoir, ScikitLearnNode, Ridge
from sklearn.linear_model import RidgeClassifier

Y_ = Y.reshape(-1, 1, 1).repeat(X.shape[1], 1)

model = Reservoir(1000, lr=0.9, sr=1.0) >> ScikitLearnNode(RidgeClassifier)
model.fit(X, Y_)
```

Correct: A

## Code Debug questions

#### 7

Here is my code:
```python
from reservoirpy.nodes import Reservoir, Ridge

model = Reservoir(units=200, lr=0.2, sr=1.0) >> Ridge(ridge=1e-4)

for x_series, y_series in zip(X_train, Y_train):
	model.fit(x_series, y_series, warmup=10)

y_pred = model.run(X_test[0])
```
Is that correct ?


A. Calling `.fit` on a model erases the previous trained results. You can instead call `.fit` once by passing the lists `X_train` and `Y_train` as parameters. 
B. Everything is correct !
C. `.fit` method is not suited for online training. Use `.train` instead.
D. Reservoir parameters should be written in full form: `leak_rate`, `spectral_radius`.

Correct: A

#### 8

Here is my code:
```python
from reservoirpy.nodes import Reservoir, Ridge

model = Reservoir(units=200, lr=0.2, sr=1.0, iss=0.2) >> Ridge(ridge=1e-4)

model.fit(X_train, Y_train, warmup=200)
Y_pred = model.run(X_test)
```
I have an error. What's wrong ?

A. `iss` is not a parameter. For scaling the input, the correct parameter is `scale_factor`.
B. Reservoir parameters should be written in full form: `leak_rate`, `spectral_radius`, `input_scaling`.
C. You must first create the reservoir and readout nodes, and then connect them, in three separate lines.
D. `iss` is not a parameter. For scaling the input, the correct parameter is `input_scaling`.

Correct: D
 
#### 9

Here is my code:
```python
from reservoirpy.nodes import Reservoir, RLS

model = Reservoir(units=200, lr=0.2, sr=1.0) >> RLS(alpha=1e-4)

for x_series, y_series in zip(X_train, Y_train):
	model.fit(x_series, y_series, warmup=10)

y_pred = model.run(X_test[0])
```
I have an error. What's wrong ?

A. The RLS node can only be trained online, but the `.fit` method is for offline training. You should use `.train` instead.
B. The model has been trained on a list of timeseries but is run on a single timeseries.
C. There is not enough units inside the reservoir. For this task, having at least 1000 neurons is recommended
D. Wrong import path: to import the `Reservoir` node, use `from reservoirpy.nodes.reservoirs import Reservoir`.

Correct: A

#### 10

Here's my code:
```python
from reservoirpy.nodes import Input, Output, Reservoir, Ridge
R1 = Reservoir(100, lr=0.01, sr=1.)
R2 = Reservoir(100, lr=0.03, sr=1.)
R3 = Reservoir(100, lr=0.09, sr=1.)
R4 = Reservoir(100, lr=0.3, sr=1.)
R5 = Reservoir(100, lr=0.9, sr=1.)
R6 = Reservoir(100, lr=0.01, sr=1.)
readout = Ridge(ridge=1e-5, name="readout")

path1, path2 = R1 >> R6, R2 >> R5
path3 = Input(name="input") >> [R1, R2, R3]
path4 = R1 >> R2 >> R3 >> R4 >> R5 >> R6 >> readout >> Output()
model = path1 & path2 & path3 & path4

model.fit({"input": X_train}, {"readout":Y_train}, warmup=10)
model.run({"input": X_test})
```
Is that correct ?

A. The `.fit` and `.run` methods only takes numpy arrays or list of numpy arrays, not dictionaries.
B. Yes, everything is correct !
C. There is a circular connection in the model.
D. `path2` is not defined.

Correct: B


#### 11

Is this the correct usage of the method `partial_fit` ?

```python

reservoir, readout = Reservoir(100, sr=1), Ridge(ridge=1e-8)

for x, y in zip(X, Y):
    states = reservoir.run(x)
    readout.partial_fit(states, y)

readout.fit()
model = reservoir >> readout
```

A. By calling the method `.fit`, the readout forgets its previous training
B. The created model won't be fitted
C. While it works, it can be simplified by creating the model and calling `partial_fit` on it
D. Yes, everything is correctly coded 

Correct: D


## 12

Here is my code:
```python
reservoir, readout = Reservoir(100, sr=1), Ridge(ridge=1e-8)
  
model = reservoir >> readout
  
model.fit(X[:800], Y[:800], warmup=10)
  
steps = 1000
results = np.zeros((steps, 1))

last_output = X[800]
for i in range(steps):
	last_output = model(last_output)
	results[i] = last_output
```
Is that the best way to have a model that generates new values by looping on itself ?

A. No, you can connect the readout to the reservoir in order to loop the results back as an input after training: `readout >> reservoir`
B. No, it won't work as the reservoir has an input dimension of 100 and the `results` array containing the results only has its feature dimension set to 1.
C. You can call the `.autoregress(n=1000)` Model method.
D. Yes, this is probably the best solution.

Correct: D

## 13

```python
weights = np.random.choice([1, -1], p=[0.6, 1 - 0.6], replace=True, size=(200, 200))
reservoir = Reservoir(W=weights, sr=0.9, lr=0.6)
```
I created my reservoir this way, but it seems the reservoir has a very chaotic behavior, even though the spectral radius is below 1.

A. The rule of the spectral radius <1 holds for matrices with a normal distribution, not a Bernoulli one, which explains why you have a chaotic behavior with a spectral radius of only 1.
B. The rule of the spectral radius <1 only holds when there is no leak rate, so that explains why you have a chaotic behavior with a spectral radius of only 1.
C. The parameter `sr` is only valid when no weight matrix has been specified. If a matrix is already specified, this argument is ignored.
D. the reservoir argument names are incorrect. You should use `spectral_radius` and `leak_rate`.

Correct: C

## 14


Here's my code:
```python
from reservoirpy.nodes import Input, Output, Reservoir, Ridge
R1 = Reservoir(100, lr=0.01, sr=1.)

R3 = Reservoir(100, lr=0.09, sr=1.)
R4 = Reservoir(100, lr=0.3, sr=1.)
R5 = Reservoir(100, lr=0.9, sr=1.)
R6 = Reservoir(100, lr=0.01, sr=1.)
readout = Ridge(ridge=1e-5, name="readout")

path1, path2 = R1 >> R6, R2 >> R5
path3 = Input(name="input") >> [R1, R2, R3]
path4 = R1 >> R2 >> R4 >> R3 >> R5 >> R6 >> readout >> Output()
model = path1 & path2 & path3 & path4

model.fit({"input": X_train}, {"readout":Y_train}, warmup=10)
model.run({"input": X_test})
```
Is that correct ?

A. The `.fit` and `.run` methods only takes numpy arrays or list of numpy arrays, not dictionaries.
B. Yes, everything is correct !
C. There is a circular connection in the model.
D. `path2` is not defined.

Correct: B
